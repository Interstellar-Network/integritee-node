# things to take into account:
# - various substrate-related deps DO NOT build on stable(or beta) b/c #![feature]
# - teaclave officially only supports: https://github.com/apache/incubator-teaclave-sgx-sdk/blob/master/rust-toolchain
# - [wallet-app repository] bevy v0.11 REQUIRES Rust 1.70+
#   relevant b/c 'integritee-node-runtime' is a dep of 'integritee-cli'["worker" repository]
# - "error: package `clap v4.4.1` cannot be built because it requires rustc 1.70.0 or newer"
# 2023-04-15: date of the latest "1.70.0-nightly"; after that it is 1.71
# https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay/blob/master/manifests/nightly/2023/2023-05-28.nix
# -> latest 1.71.0-nightly
# a good source to check which nightly is which Rust version: https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay/tree/master/manifests/nightly/
